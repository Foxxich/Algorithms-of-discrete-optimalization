#Solutions for three tasks from algorithms of discrete optimization
## by Vadym Liss (257264)
###Information
'src' folder has all our classes;


'obj' folder has generated '*.o' files;


'include' folder has headers for 4 main classes;


'bin' folder has binary files of implemented algorithms: dijkstra, dial, radixheap;


'results' folder results of tests for implemented algorithms (not added!): dijkstra, dial, radixheap;

###Task1
In this task we needed to implement Dijkstra algorithm

###Task2
In this task we needed to implement Dial modification of Dijkstra algorithm

###Task3
In this task we needed to implement RadixHeap modification of Dijkstra algorithm
